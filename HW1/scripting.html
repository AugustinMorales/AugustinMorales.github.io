    Scripting languages are programming languages that attempt to automate what would typically be done by a singular person.
    These languages are typically interpreted languages as stated on the previous pages interpreted languages don't translate directly into 
    machine code rather they get read and executed by a different program. Examples of scripting languages are JavaScript, Python, and PHP
